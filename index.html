<p>Citizen Labs is a Grand Rapids, MI based organization that believes engaged citizens can improve their communities.</p>

<p><strong>We work</strong> together with our community to use open data and open source technology to promote transparency, better understand problems, make better choices, and provide solutions that work.</p>

<p><strong>We are</strong> developers, designers, data geeks, leaders, and idea-makers who volunteer to help local and state governments, and civic organizations.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://grbudget.citizenlabs.org">Open Budget: Grand Rapids</a>: Launched on June 6, 2016, the Open Budget project promotes a deeper understanding of the city budget of Grand Rapids, so that citizens, officials, and other stakeholders can engage in more informed dialog about how the City of Grand Rapids currently works and how it should in the future.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://grparks.citizenlabs.org/">Grand Rapids Parks &amp; Recreation Investments</a>: The GR Parks Project launched September 2016 and uses open source <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> and data from the City of Grand Rapids to show the parks of the City of Grand Rapids, the tax dollars invested in each park thus far, and details of updates made. The investments in our parks were made possible by dedicated property millage for capital and pool operations, and major repair and rehabilitation of parks and playgrounds that residents of Grand Rapids voted in favor of on November 5, 2013.</li>
